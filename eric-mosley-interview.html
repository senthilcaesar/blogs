        <h3>
          Over the past few years, culture has become a top business priority.
          In a shifting macro environment, is it still important? How do you see
          it connecting to organizational performance and goals?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I think there's still some confusion about what culture is and why it
          matters. The reality is, culture is the operating system of
          performance. The data consistently shows that companies with strong
          cultures outperform their peers on productivity, innovation and
          retention, especially during disruption. For example, in
          manufacturing, our data shows that sites that used recognition
          effectively saw 70% year-over-year improvement in productivity, safety
          and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In downturns or transformation periods, culture becomes a multiplier
          of resilience. It determines how quickly people adapt, collaborate and
          recommit to shared purpose when everything else is uncertain. The
          conversation has evolved from "Is culture important?" to "What can
          culture deliver and how do we quantify it?" — and recognition data is
          finally making that possible.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What advice do you have for leaders looking to promote a culture of
          recognition that is authentic and actionable?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mosley: Recognition must be embedded in the rhythm of work, not
          reserved for special occasions. The most successful leaders make it a
          habit with daily, specific appreciation that is tied to, and reflects,
          real impact. But authentic recognition comes from the crowd, not just
          the corner office.
        </p>
        <p>
          When peers celebrate one another, it builds trust, fairness and a
          sense of shared ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, treat recognition like a business process. Measure it, track
          equity across teams and connect it to outcomes like engagement,
          retention and innovation. When you opera-tionalize appreciation,
          culture becomes measurable — but just as importantly, it produces data
          that makes culture manageable and scalable.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Many companies are experimenting with Al in human resources. What are
          the biggest mistakes, misconceptions or missed opportunities you see?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mosley: The biggest mistake I see is assuming AI will solve cultural
          problems without fixing the data hrst. Bad data in means bad decisions
          out, and many HR systems are still built on incomplete or biased
          inputs like performance reviews or demographic data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another misconception is seeing Al purely as an efficiency tool. The
          real opportunity is to use Al for illumination: to understand people,
          potential and connection in ways we couldn't before. For example, a
          leader might ask, "Who would be the best person to lead this new
          initiative?" or "Who is the best mentor in engineering?" and get
          instant answers that help them make key talent decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, leaders must remember, AI doesn't change your culture; it
          amplifies it. If you train AI on transactional data, you get
          transactional outcomes. If you train it on human data, you get what we
          call "Human Intelligence," or the insight layer that gives you
          decision-ready insights and drives better leadership.
